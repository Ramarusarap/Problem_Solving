# LeetCode Problem Solving Repository

This repository is a personal, long-term collection of all the problems I solve on LeetCode.  
The primary objective is to stay consistently aligned with problem-solving fundamentals and to continuously improve solution quality over time.

## Purpose

- Build strong algorithmic thinking through regular practice
- Develop the habit of **iterative optimization** rather than one-time solutions
- Maintain a structured reference for revisiting and refining approaches
- Prepare systematically for product-based company interviews

## Repository Structure

- Problems are organized by **problem-solving patterns / divisions** (e.g., arrays, hashing, sliding window, dynamic programming, SQL, etc.)
- **Each problem has its own folder**
- Inside each problem folder, **multiple approaches** are maintained:
  - Brute force
  - Optimized solutions
  - Space-optimized or alternative strategies (when applicable)

This ensures clarity in understanding how a solution evolves.

## Iterative Improvement Philosophy

This repository is **not built in a single day**.

For many problems:
- An initial solution may be simple or suboptimal
- Better approaches are added later as understanding improves
- Existing solutions may be refactored or optimized over time

The goal is to reflect **learning progression**, not just final answers.

## Languages Used

- Python (primary)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)

## Commitment

This repository is updated **incrementally and consistently** as I continue solving problems and discovering better approaches.
